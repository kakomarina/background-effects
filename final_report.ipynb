    "This project aims to change the background of a given image with a centered object on it by using image segmentation. The process necessarily includes image segmentation, but might also include background removal, background blur or background change of some kind, such as color change or filtering. The applications of the project are entirely focused on the arts, as aesthetics purposes in photography or personal entertainment. \\\n",

    "In the first place, we are going to implement background change in images with simple backgrounds, that means that they do not have many different colors or objects. For that, thresholding methods are going to be used. In a second moment, we are going to implement the segmentation for images with more complex backgrounds, with algorithms such as image segmentation with clustering. \n"

The Triangle Thresholding Method chooses the value that forms the triangle with the biggest d (as shown on the image above) as the threshold. \n",

    "In conclusion, we observed that the thresholding method is efficient for pictures with a strong contrast between the background and the main object. Whereas the clustering does not depend on the contrast, but the colors. It works well if the central object does not have the same color as the background, and these cases are easiest to find, therefore making this method more general. \n",

    "Another important observation is that the noise reduction in the pre-processing is relevant for the image segmentation, as it makes the image's borders less noisy and cleaner. \n",
